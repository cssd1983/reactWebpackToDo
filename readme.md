This app  tutorial I did in April 2017 to practice using React and webpack.
After finishing the tutorial I went back through and wrote comments describing
the code.

I had a great time learning React with this tutorial and I hope it helps you!

To test this or use as boilerplate for your React app, clone this repository
and run...

webpack-dev-server
